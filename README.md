# Colliding-Cubes

## Inspiration
At first, I was intending to build a 3D Tetris Game, but this turned out much harder than expected. So, I transformed it into similar game with a moving cube.
## What it does
There is a cube which the player controls using "w", "s", "a", "d", up, down, left, and right for moving forward, moving, backward, moving, left, moving right, moving up, moving down, turning the screen left, and turning the screen right, respectively.
## How I built it
This game was built using Python, specifically using the libraries pygame (for making the screen and taking inputs) and OpenGL (for rendering and doing math). 
## Challenges I ran into
Originally for the Tetris idea, I had to stop working on it because brute forcing all of the 3D tetrominos is not very fun. Also, I don't have much experience with classes in python so I struggled making tetromino objects.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of getting all of the movements to work properly, especially the "WASD" keys based on the orientation of the outside cube
## What I learned
I learned a lot about how objects are rendered in OpenGL along with an understanding of the linear algebra behind how the projections work.
## What's next for Colliding Cubes
I am going to continue with my original idea of the Tetris.
